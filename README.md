# RAG-Law-Builder

In this project, our objective is to leverage OpenAI to build a robust vector database specifically tailored to UAE laws. Additionally, we create a dedicated dataset for fine-tuning the Llama3 model. Our ultimate goal is to develop an exceptional AI-lawyer by utilizing the created dataset and employing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, harnessing the power of the vector database.
