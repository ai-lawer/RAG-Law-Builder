7. If Q is not equal to X, the tax able person  shall perform the calculation described in Clauses (8) to (11) of this Article and shall make an adjustment to his Input Tax.
8. The tax able person  shall calculate an amount (referred to as “R” in this Article) as:
a. One tenth of W multiplied by Q if the capital asset is a building or a part thereof; or
b. One fifth of W multiplied by Q if the capital asset is not a buildings or a part thereof.
9. The tax able person  shall calculate an amount (referred to as “Z” in this Article) as:
a. One tenth of W multiplied by X if the capital asset is a building or a part thereof;
b. One fifth of W multiplied by X if the capital asset is not a buildings or a part thereof.
10. If R is more than Z, the tax able person  shall increase his input tax by the difference.

12. If the capital asset is disposed of by the tax able person in this case, what adjustment would you make to the input tax calculation?","Based on Article (58) of the Decree-Law, since the capital asset has been used for 7 years and is now being disposed of, we need to calculate the adjustment to the input tax calculation. According to Clause (8), if R is more than Z, the tax able person shall increase his input tax by the difference. Since R is calculated as one tenth of W multiplied by Q, and Q is the percentage Refundable Tax for that Capital Asset for that year in accordance with Article (58) of the Decree-Law, we need to calculate the value of Q. As the capital asset has been used for 7 years, it falls under the category of other capital assets, which have a depreciation period of 5 years. Therefore, Q would be the percentage Refundable Tax for that Capital Asset for that year in accordance with Article (58) of the Decree-Law, which is equivalent to 20%. The value of R would then be one fifth of W multiplied by 20%, which is 4% of W. Since Z is calculated as one fifth of W multiplied by X, and X is the refundable input tax on the capital asset in Year 1 after any adjustment that may be due under article (58) of the Decree-Law, we need to calculate the value of X. As the capital asset has been used for 7 years, it has already undergone the initial depreciation of 20% in Year 1. Therefore, X would be the remaining refundable input tax on the capital asset, which is equivalent to 16%. The value of Z would then be one fifth of W multiplied by 16%, which is 3.2% of W. Since R is more than Z, the tax able person shall increase his input tax by the difference, which is 0.8% of W."

Agreements: : Agreements, arrangements, consortia or practices between two or more undertakings, any cooperation among undertakings, or decisions made by associations of undertakings, whether they are written or verbal, explicit or implicit, public or confidential.","Based on Article (1) Definitions, the agreement not to poach each other's employees would be considered an 'Agreement' under the Decree-Law.

Providing a stimulating environment for undertakings to enhance effectiveness, competitiveness and consumer's interest and achieve a sustainable development in the State; and 2. Maintaining a competitive market governed by market mechanisms, in line with the principle of economic freedom, by prohibiting agreements, conducts and acts that constitute abuse of a dominant position, monitoring all economic concentrations and avoiding any act that would distort, lessen, restrict or prevent free competition.","Based on Article 2 of the Decree-Law, it appears that XYZ Inc. may be engaging in monopolistic practices that constitute an abuse of their dominant position. Specifically, their dominance in the market for the product in question may be preventing free competition and distorting the competitive market. As a result, I would recommend investigating further to determine whether any agreements or conducts by XYZ Inc. are indeed illegal under Article 2."
"A company, XYZ Inc., has just launched a new smartphone with advanced camera features. The company claims that this innovation is solely theirs and wants to prevent other companies from copying their technology.","Article (3) Applicability
The provisions of this Decree-Law shall apply to all undertakings, in relation to their economic activities in the State, to the exploitation of intellectual property rights inside and outside the State, and to economic activities practiced outside the State and affecting competition in the State.","Based on Article (3) Applicability, since XYZ Inc. is exploiting an intellectual property right (their camera technology innovation) outside the State and affecting competition in the State, this Decree-Law applies to their situation. Therefore, I would recommend that XYZ Inc. file for patent protection for their innovative camera technology and consider taking legal action against any companies that attempt to copy or infringe upon their rights. Article (3) explicitly covers 'the exploitation of intellectual property rights inside and outside the State' and 'economic activities practiced outside the State and affecting competition in the State', which applies directly to XYZ Inc.'s situation."

"A company named XYZ has a market share of 80% in the market for electric toothbrushes and has been accused of unfairly rejecting orders from other retailers, forcing them to purchase toothbrushes at inflated prices from XYZ's authorized distributors. XYZ claims that this is due to high demand and limited supply. Is XYZ abusing its dominant position?","Article (6) Abuse of Dominant Position 1. Any undertaking which, either individually or in collaboration with other undertakings, holds a dominant position in the relevant market, or in a significant and influential part thereof, shall be prohibited from performing any act or conduct which constitutes such an abuse of position as its object or effect is to distort, lessen, restrict or prevent competition. Such acts and conducts may include: ... 

 2. The dominant position referred to in Clause (1) of this Article shall be established in any of the following cases: ...","Based on Article (6), I believe that XYZ is abusing its dominant position by unfairly rejecting orders from other retailers, forcing them to purchase toothbrushes at inflated prices from XYZ's authorized distributors.

Article (3) specifically prohibits obliging a customer not to deal with a competing undertaking, which is exactly what XYZ Inc.'s contract does by prohibiting customers from purchasing solar panels from other companies for a certain period. Additionally, the requirement to purchase installation services only from XYZ Inc. also constitutes an unjustifiable condition of reselling goods or services (Article (1)). The Federal Decree-Law No. 36 of 2023 Regulating Competition prohibits such practices and requires undertakings to operate fairly and transparently in their dealings with customers."
"A company, XYZ Inc., has been accused of predatory pricing by reducing its prices significantly below production costs. The goal is to drive out a competitor from the market.

In accordance with the controls established by the Executive Regulations hereof, setting or applying prices of selling to consumers which are excessively lower than the costs of production, manufacturing and marketing shall be prohibited when the goal or result of such practice is to drive an undertaking or one of its products out of the relevant market or to prevent such undertaking or one of its products from entering the relevant market. 2. Making general price cuts as provided for in Federal Law No. (15) of 2020 on Consumer Protection, as amended, and its Executive Regulations, or any other replacement law, or the liquidation of commercial shops shall be exempt from the provisions of Clause (1) of this Article. 3. The Cabinet may, upon the Minister's proposal, exempt any price cuts or sales quotations that are excessively low, in line with the requirements of the economic status.","Based on Article 8 of the competition law, I would apply this law to XYZ Inc.'s situation because the company has set prices excessively lower than its production costs with the goal of driving out a competitor from the market. This is prohibited by Clause (1) of this Article. The fact that XYZ Inc. has reduced its prices significantly does not qualify for exemption under Clause (2), as it is not making general price cuts, and the liquidation of commercial shops is also not applicable in this case. Therefore, we should prevent XYZ Inc.'s predatory pricing practice to ensure fair competition in the market."

What can they do?","Article 13: If the number of exporters, producers, importers, types of products or transactions under investigation is substantially large to such extent which make such investigation impracticable, the investigation may be limited to a representative sample of Related Parties, products under investigation or transactions, by using statistically-valid samples based on either the information available at the time of selection or the largest percentage of export volume, production, or sales of the country concerned which can be reasonably verified during the period of the investigation.","I would recommend limiting the investigation to a representative sample of exporters, producers, importers, products under investigation, or transactions. This is in accordance with Article 13, which allows for a statistically-valid sample to be used when an investigation becomes impracticable due to its large scope. By selecting a representative sample, we can still gather meaningful data and insights while minimizing the burden on investigators and reducing the time required for the investigation."

"A company called XYZ from China exports steel pipes to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The UAE authorities are investigating whether this exportation has caused harm to the domestic industry and determining the normal value of the steel pipes. There are no direct sales of similar products in the Chinese market, but there are indirect sales through intermediate countries. What is the normal value of the steel pipes?","Article (27) 
1. The normal value shall be calculated based on the comparable price paid or payable, in the ordinary course of trade, for sales of similar product by independent customers in the domestic market of the exporting country.
2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1 above, where a product under investigation is not imported directly from the country of origin but is exported to the State from an intermediate country, the normal value shall be established on the basis of comparable price paid or payable, in the ordinary course of trade, in the domestic market of the country of origin if the products are not produced in the exporting country (i.e., the products are merely transhipped through the exporting country), or there is no comparable price for them in the exporting country.
3. In the case of an association, partnerships agreements or a compensatory arrangement or other related arrangements form of compensatory arrangement among Related Parties, prices among them may be considered to be not in the ordinary course of trade and may not be used to establish normal value.
4. Sales of the similar product destined for consumption in the domestic market of the exporting country shall be considered to be of sufficient quantity for the determination of the normal value if such sales constitute five percent (5%) or more of the export sales volume of the product under investigation to the State. However, a volume of sales lower than five percent (5%) of sales may be used if the Department is satisfied, based on the evidence to be submitted or otherwise available, that the sales of such lower volume are nonetheless of sufficient magnitude to provide for proper comparison.
5. When there are no sales of the similar product in the ordinary course of trade in the domestic market of the exporting country, or when a proper comparison cannot be made under such sales due to the particular market situation or the low volume of the sales in the domestic market of the exporting country, the normal value of the similar product shall be established on the basis of the cost of production in the country of origin plus a reasonable amount for administrative selling and general costs as well as for profit margin, or on the basis of export price, in the ordinary course of trade, to an appropriate third country, provided that this price is reason able.
6. Sales of the similar product in the domestic market of an exporting country or export sales to a third country at prices below per unit either fixed and variable, costs of production plus administration, selling and general costs shall not be treated as being in the ordinary course of trade by reason of price, and thereby may be disregarded in determining the normal value, only if it is determined that such sales were made:
a. Within an extended period of time, which shall normally be for one (1) year and shall in no case be less than six (6) months.
b. In substantial quantities, when it is established that the weighted average selling price of the transactions under consideration for the determination of the normal value is below the weighted average unit cost, or that the volume of sales below cost is not less than twenty percent (20%) of sales under consideration for the determination of the normal value.
c. At prices which do not provide for recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time, if prices which are below per unit costs at the time of sale are above the weighted average per unit cost for the period of investigation, such prices shall be considered as providing for recovery of costs within a reasonable period of time.
7. Where the country exporting the product under investigation is a non-market economy country, normal value may be determined on the basis of: -(1) the comparable price paid or payable or constructed normal value, in the ordinary course of trade, for sales of the similar product when destined for consumption in a market economy of a third country; (2) the comparable price paid or payable, in the ordinary course of trade, for exports of the similar product from such a market economy of the third country to other countries, including the State; or (3) any other reasonable basis including the price actually paid or payable in the State for the similar product, duly adjusted if necessary to include a reasonable amount for administrative selling and general costs as well as for profit margin.","According to Article 27(2), since there are no direct sales of similar products in the Chinese market, we need to look at indirect sales through intermediate countries. Since China is not producing steel pipes for its domestic market, we can consider the comparable price paid or payable in the domestic market of the country of origin (in this case, the intermediate country). The normal value of the steel pipes is therefore determined based on the comparable price paid or payable in the domestic market of the intermediate country."
"A company exports a product to another country and wants to determine its export price. However, there is no direct sale from the exporter to an independent buyer. Instead, the product is sold to a related company that imports similar products from third-party suppliers. The exporter also provides technical assistance to the importer in exchange for a low price.","Article (28) 
1. The export price shall be determin ed on the basis of the price paid or to be paid for the product under investigation when it is sold for export from the exporting country to the domestic market.
2. In cases where there is no export price of the product under  investigation or where it appears that the export price is unreliable because of association or a compensatory arrangement between the exporter and the importer or a third party, the export price may be constructed on the basis of the price at which the imported products are resold to first independent buyer, or if those products are not resold to an independent buyer, or not resold in the condition as they were imported, or any reasonable basis.","To determine the export price, I would construct it based on the price at which the imported products are resold to a first independent buyer. This is according to Article (28), Section 2 of the law, which allows for this method when there is no direct sale from the exporter to an independent buyer and the export price appears unreliable due to association or compensatory arrangement."
"A company exports a certain product to another country and wants to determine if it's dumping. It compares its export price with its normal value, but there are some differences between the two prices.","Article (29) 
1. A fair comparison shall be drawn between the export price and the normal value.
2. This comparison shall be drawn at the same level of trade, normally at the ex-factory level, and in respect of sales made as close as possible to the same time with due account to be taken in consideration, the settlements for differences which affect price comparability. This comparison includes differences in conditions and terms of sale, physical characteristics, import charges, taxation, quantities, level of trade, and any other differences which are claimed and also demonstrated by Related Parties to affect prices and price comparability.
3. If the export price is determined on the basis of the selling price of the product under investigation to the first independent buyer in the domestic market, the allowances for costs, including duties and taxes, incurred by importation and resale, as well as profit margins accruing, shall also be made. In the case that price comparability has been affected, the normal value shall be calculated at a level of trade equivalent to the level of trade of the constructed export price or due allowances shall be made for the differences mentioned in this Article.","To determine if the company is dumping, we need to compare its export price with its normal value. Since there are some differences between the two prices, we need to consider these differences and make sure that the comparison is fair. We should draw the comparison at the same level of trade, normally at the ex-factory level, and in respect of sales made as close as possible to the same time (Article 29(2)). If the export price is determined on the basis of the selling price of the product under investigation to the first independent buyer in the domestic market, we should also make allowances for costs, including duties and taxes, incurred by importation and resale, as well as profit margins accruing (Article 29(3))."
How would you determine the dumping margin for a product under investigation?,"Article 30
1. The margin of dumping shall be normally determined during the investigation period, on the basis of a comparison between the weighted average of the normal value and the weighted average of export price, for all exports of the product under investigation to the domestic market, or by comparing the normal value and the export price on transaction-by-transaction basis.
2. A normal value established on a weighted average basis may be compared to prices of individual export transactions to the domestic market, if there is a pattern of export prices which differ significantly among different purchasers, regions or time period, and if using the methods in paragraph 1 would not reflect the total margin of dumping properly.
3. Dumping margin shall be determined based on the amount by which the normal value exceeds the export price. An individual dumping margin shall be determined for each known exporter or producer concerned by the product under investigation.
4. Subject to the provisions of paragraph (3) of this Article, in cases where the number of exporters, producers, importers, or types of products involved or trade transactions is substantially large to such extent which makes it impracticable to determine an individual dumping margin for each known exporter or producer, the investigation may be limited to an examination of a reasonable number of Related Parties, products or transactions by using samples which are statistically valid on the basis of information available at the time of the selection, or through the largest percentage of the volume of production, sales or exports which can reasonably be investigated within the given time-limit.
5. When an investigation is limited to a given sample in accordance with this Article and Article 13, any anti-dumping measures applied to imports from exporters or producers which have made themselves known but not included in the sample shall not exceed the weighted average dumping margin established with respect to the selected exporters or producers provided that any zero, minimal margins, and margins established in circumstances referred to in Article 26 hereof shall be disregarded.
6. In cases where the examination is limited in accordance with this Article and Article 13, individual determinations of dumping margin shall be made for any exporter or producer not initially selected who submits the necessary information within the time-limit for that.","To determine the dumping margin, I would first establish a normal value by comparing the weighted average of normal values to the weighted average of export prices. If there is a pattern of export prices that differ significantly among different purchasers, regions or time periods, I would compare the normal value to individual export transactions to the domestic market. The dumping margin would be determined as the amount by which the normal value exceeds the export price. Article 30(3) states that an individual dumping margin should be determined for each known exporter or producer concerned by the product under investigation."
A domestic steel manufacturer claims that imported steel from China is causing material injury to their industry.,"Article (31) A material injury to domestic industry shall be identified based on an objective examination of all positive evidence, including: 1. The volume of dumped imports and their impact on the prices of the sale of similar products in the domestic market as evidenced by the following: a. With regard to the volume of dumped imports, consideration shall be made to whether there has been a significant increase in dumped imports, either in absolute terms or relative to production or consumption in the State's market. b. With regard to the effect of imports dumped on the prices of the sale of the similar product in the domestic market, consideration shall be made to whether: - There has been a significant price undercutting in such dumped imports when compared with the price of the domestic similar product; - There has been a significant price undercutting in the domestic similar product by such dumped imports; or - The effect of such imports is to prevent price increases, which otherwise would have occurred, to a significant degree. c. No one or several of the factors identified in paragraph 1 of this Article can necessarily provide decisive guidance to material injury. 2. The impact of the dumped imports on the domestic industry involved, through an evaluation of all relevant economic factors and indices having a bearing on the state of the industry, including: a. Actual and potential decline in sales, profits, production, market share, productivity, return on investments, or utilization of capacity; b. Factors affecting the domestic market prices; actual and potential negative effects on cash flow, inventories, employment, wages, investment, growth, and ability to increase capital; and c. The magnitude of the dumping margin. d. This list is not exhaustive, nor can any one or more of these factors necessarily give decisive guidance to the occurrence of material injury. 3. The impact of the dumped imports shall be assessed in relation to the domestic production of the similar product, when available data allow separate identification of that production on the basis of criteria such as the production process and producers' sales and profits. If such separate identification of production is not possible, the evaluation of the impact of dumped imports shall be undertaken by searching in narrowest group or range of products which include the similar product on which the necessary information can be provided.","To determine material injury to the domestic steel industry, I would first examine the volume of imported steel from China and its impact on the prices of similar products in the market (Article 31). If there has been a significant increase in dumped imports or price undercutting by these imports, it may indicate material injury. Next, I would evaluate the impact of these imports on the domestic industry through an assessment of relevant economic factors such as sales, profits, production, and market share. If actual or potential decline is observed in any of these areas, it could be indicative of material injury (Article 31). Finally, I would assess the magnitude of the dumping margin to determine if it has a significant impact on the domestic industry."
"A company called XYZ Inc. is concerned that imports of solar panels from China will cause material injury to their domestic industry. They are considering filing an anti-dumping complaint with the authorities. Based on Article (32) of the law, can they establish a threat of material injury?","Article (32)
1. A threat of material injury on the domestic industry shall be identified on facts and not merely on allegation, conjecture or remote possibility and on an examination of whether such injury is clearly foreseeable and imminent, subject to the following:
a. A significant rate of increase of dumped imports into the domestic market indicating the likelihood of substantially increased importations;
b. Sufficient production capacity of the exporter or an imminent, substantial increase in such capacity indicating the likelihood of substantially increased dumped exports to the domestic market, taking into account the availability of other export markets to accommodate any additional exports;
c. Whether imports are entering at prices that will have a significant depressing or suppressing effect on domestic prices and would likely increase demand for further imports;
d. Inventories of the product under investigation.
2. Other relevant factors that are supported by sufficient evidence may be taken into consideration. However, no one or several of these factors listed above, alone or in combination, can necessarily give decisive guidance but the totality of the factors considered shall lead to a conclusion that more dumped exports are imminent and that, unless countervailing measures action are taken, the material injury will occur.","To establish a threat of material injury, XYZ Inc. needs to demonstrate that all the factors in Article (32) are met. In this case, they can show a significant rate of increase in dumped imports into the domestic market (Article (32), point a). They also need to provide evidence that the Chinese exporter has sufficient production capacity or is planning a substantial increase in production capacity (Article (32), point b). Additionally, XYZ Inc. must prove that the imported solar panels are entering the market at prices that will have a significant depressing effect on domestic prices and would likely increase demand for further imports (Article (32), point c). Finally, they need to provide information about their own inventories of the product under investigation (Article (32), point d). If XYZ Inc. can meet all these conditions, they may be able to establish a threat of material injury and file an anti-dumping complaint. (Article (32))"
A domestic manufacturer of steel pipes has been experiencing declining sales and increased competition from imports. They claim that the dumped imports are causing injury to their industry. What factors should be examined to verify this hypothesis?,"Article (33) 
1. It shall be verified that injuries caused to the domestic industry are resulting from dumped imports and they are not related to other reasons.
2. Known factors other than dumped imports, which are at the same time injuring the domestic industry, shall be examined, and injuries caused by these other factors shall not be attributed to the dumped imports. Factors which may be relevant in this respect include, inter alia:
a. The volume and prices of imports not sold at dumped prices.
b. Contraction in demand or changes in the patterns of consumption.
c. Commercial restrictions and competitions between domestic and foreign producers.
d. Developments in technologies.
e. Development of export performance and productivity of the domestic industry.","To verify whether injuries caused to the domestic steel pipe manufacturer are resulting from dumped imports, I will examine factors such as the volume and prices of imports not sold at dumped prices (Article 33, clause 2(a)). Additionally, I will look into other known factors that may be injuring the industry, such as changes in demand or consumption patterns (Article 33, clause 2(b)), commercial restrictions and competitions with foreign producers (Article 33, clause 2(c)), technological developments, and the export performance and productivity of the domestic industry. If any of these factors are found to be causing injury to the industry, they will not be attributed to the dumped imports."
Can imports from multiple countries with dumping margins above 2% and volumes above 3% be cumulatively assessed?,"Article (34) 
Where imports of a product from more than one country are simultaneously subjected to an anti -dumping investigation, the effects of such imports shall be cumulatively assessed only if it is determined that: 
1. The margin of dumping established in relation to the imports from each country is more than the minimal  dumping margin, two percent (2%) or more of the export price; 
2. The volume of the dumped imports from each country is not negligible, which three percent (3%) or more from total of the State’s imports of the product under investigation; and 
3. A cumulative assessment of the effects of the imports is appropriate in light of the conditions of competition among the imported products from concerned countries, and the conditions of competition among the imports and the like domestic product.","Based on Article (34), yes, imports from multiple countries with dumping margins above 2% and volumes above 3% can be cumulatively assessed. The condition is met because both the margin of dumping (above 2%) and the volume of dumped imports (above 3%) are satisfied. According to this law, a cumulative assessment of the effects of the imports is appropriate in light of the conditions of competition among the imported products from concerned countries. Therefore, the imports can be cumulatively assessed (Article 34, clause 1-2)."
"Should we terminate an investigation into dumping of a certain product from Country X and Country Y? The complaint was filed by a domestic manufacturer, and the initial findings show that the dumped imports account for 2% of the total imports of this product in our country. However, when considering all countries under investigation, their combined share is around 10%. What should we do?","Article (35) 
 An immediate termination of the investigation shall be recommen ded without imposing measures in any of the following cases: 
 1. Withdrawal of the complaint, unless where such termination is against the State’s interest. 
 2. There is no sufficient evidence for the existence of dumping, injury or causal relationship between the m to justify the continuation of an investigation. 
 3. When the dumping margin is minimal, i.e. less than two percent (2%), expressed as a percentage of the export price. 
 4. If the volume of dumped imports of the product under investigation from a particular country is negligible; i.e. less than three percent (3%) of the total imports of the product under investigation to the domestic market, unless imports from all countries under investigation which individually account for less than three percent (3%) of the total imports of the product under investigation collectively account for more than seven (7%) percent of imports of the product under investigation to the domestic market.","Based on Article (35)4, since the dumped imports from Country X and Country Y account for only 2% of the total imports, which is below the threshold of 3%, we should terminate the investigation. However, we need to consider whether the combined share of all countries under investigation exceeds 7%. Since it's around 10%, we can conclude that this case does not meet the criteria for termination. Therefore, we should continue the investigation."
"Can provisional anti-dumping measures be imposed if an investigation has been initiated and public notice has been published, but related parties have not yet had adequate opportunity to submit information and make comments?","Article (36) Anti -Dumping Measures 1. The Minister or his delegate  may, upon the recommendation of the Advisory Committee,  impose provisional anti -dumping measures if:  a. An investigation has been initiated and public notice has been published in the Official Gazette or the State’s two most popular daily newspapers .  b. Related Parties have been given adequate opportunity to  submit information and make comments; and  c. An initial affirmative determination of dumping indicates that there is a consequent injury to the domestic industry , and provisional measures are necessary to prevent injury being caused during the investigation. However, an initial negative determination of dumping does not necessarily lead to terminating the investigation; however, in such a case, no provisional measures shall be imposed.","No, according to Article (36) Anti -Dumping Measures, provisional anti-dumping measures cannot be imposed if related parties have not yet had adequate opportunity to submit information and make comments. The law explicitly states that 'b. Related Parties have been given adequate opportunity to  submit information and make comments; and' as a condition for imposing provisional measures."

What if an exporter offers a voluntary undertaking to increase prices of the product under investigation to eliminate the dumping margin?,"Article (39)
Undertakings
1. Upon the approval of the Minister or his delegate , an investigation may be suspended or 
terminated without imposing anti -dumping measures when the Department receives a 
satisfactory voluntary undertaking from any exporters, which eliminates the injurious effect 
of the dumping. Such undertakings shall take any of the following for ms: 
a. The commitment by an exporter to increase prices of the product under investigation into 
the State in order to eliminate the dumping margin.
b. The commitment by an exporter to cease exports at dumped prices to the State of the 
products under investigatio n.
2. Price undertakings shall not be sought or accepted from exports unless an initial  affirmative 
determination of dumping, injury, and a causal  relationship has been made.
3. Undertakings offered shall not be accepted if their acceptance is considered impractical, as for 
the number of actual or potential exporters is too great, or for any other reasons, including 
reasons of general policy. Should the case arise and when practic able, the exporter shall be 
provided with the reasons that have led to a consideration that the acceptance  of an 
undertaking would be inappropriate and shall, to the extent possible, be given an opportunity 
to make written comments thereon.
4. Parties providi ng a price undertaking shall submit a non -confidential version of such 
undertakings, so that it may be made available to Related Parties  of the investigation on 
request.
5. Price undertakings may be suggested by the Department to exporters; however, no export er 
shall be forced to enter into such undertakings. The fact that exporters do not offer or accept 
such undertakings shall in no way prejudice the consideration of the case. However, it may be 
determined that a threat of injury is more likely to be realize d if the dumped imports continue.
","According to Article (39), the Department will consider the voluntary undertaking to increase prices of the product under investigation and suspend or terminate the investigation without imposing anti-dumping measures if it eliminates the injurious effect of the dumping. The commitment by the exporter to increase prices must be satisfactory and eliminate the dumping margin, as per Article 1(a). (Article 39)"

An exporter has been found to have violated their price undertaking by selling products at a lower price than what was agreed upon.,"Article (41) 
1. Exporter whose undertakings have been accepted shall provide periodically to the Department information relevant to the fulfilment of such undertakings and shall permit verification of pertinent data. Failure to comply with such requirements shall be deemed to be a violation of the undertakings.
2. If it is found that the price undertaking is violated, the Department may submit a recommendation to the Minister to impose provisional measures in accordance with Article 36 hereof, on the basis of the best information available. In such a case, final anti-dumping duties may be retroactively levied on products entered for consumption, from the date of violation, with no more than ninety (90) days before the application of provisional measures.
3. If it is found that the price undertaking is violated by any exporter, the Minister or his delegate may forthwith impose the provisional or definitive measures which have been already imposed on other exporters; provided that the exporter has been granted an opportunity to comment and unless it has withdrawn the undertakings.","As per Article (41), I will recommend to the Minister to impose provisional measures in accordance with Article 36.

1. Provisional measures and final anti -dumping duties  shall only be applied to products 
imported for consumption from the effective date of imposition, subject to the exceptions in 
pagraph 2 of this Article, and Articles 44 and 45 hereof.
2. The Minister or hi s delegate  may, upon on a proposal by the Advisory Committee, impose final 
anti -dumping duties  retroactively as of the period in which provisional measures have been 
applied, where:
a. A final determination of material injury has been made; or
b. A final determination of threat of material injury has been made where it is found that the 
provisional anti -dumping measures prevented the occurrence of the material injury.","Yes, we can apply the final anti-dumping duty retroactively because a final determination of material injury has been made (Article 42(2)(a)).

1. Where the final anti -dumping duties are higher than the provisional duties paid or payable, or the amount estimated for the purpose of security, the difference shall not be collected. If the definitive duties are lower than the provisional duty paid or payable, or the amount estimated for the purpose of security, the difference shall be reimbursed,  or the duties recalculated. 
2. Where a final determination is negative, any cash deposit made during the period of the application of provisional measures shall be refunded and any bonds shall be expeditiously released.","According to Article (43), since the final duty ($80,000) is lower than the provisional duty paid or payable ($100,000), the difference ($20,000) should be reimbursed. The company should receive a refund of $20,000."

Final anti-dumping duties may be levied on products which were imported to the State for consumption not more than ninety (90) days prior to the date of application of provisional measures, but not prior to the date of initiation of the investigation provided that:
1. There is a history of dumping for the product under investigation prior to the period of investigation initiation or that the importer was, or should have been aware, that the exporter practices dumping and that such dumping would cause injury.
2. The inj ury is caused by increased dumped imports of a product in a relatively short period of time which, in light of the timing and the volume of the dumped imports and other circumstances such as a rapid build-up of inventories of the imported product, is likely to seriously undermine the remedial effect of final anti-dumping duties to be applied, provided that the importers concerned have been given an opportunity to comment.
3. The Minister or his delegate may, after initiating an investigation, take such measures as withholding of appraisement or assessment as may be necessary to collect anti-dumping duties retroactively, as provided in this Article, once it has sufficient evidence that the conditions set forth in this Article are satisfied.","As per Article (45), since the product was imported within the last 90 days prior to the date of application of provisional measures, and there is a history of dumping for the product under investigation prior to the period of investigation initiation or that the importer was, or should have been aware, that the exporter practices dumping and that such dumping would cause injury (Condition 1), the company is eligible for final anti-dumping duties.

Is a grant from the government of country X to a private company to develop a new technology a subsidy?,"Article (49) A subsidy shall be deemed to have existence if: 
1. There is direct or indirect financial contribution, by the government of the country of origin or export or a public body, that confers a benefit upon the recipient, i.e. where the government:
a. Conducts  a direct transfer of funds (e.g. grants and loans), or potential direct transfers of funds or liabilities (e.g. loan guarantees) . 
b. Waives the government accrued revenue s or abandons to collect them , such as tax deduction . 
c. Provides  goods or services other than public infrastructure, or purchases goods . 
d. Makes payments by a funding mechanism, or entrusts or directs a private body to carry out one or more of the type of functions mentioned in (a), (b) and (c) above which, would normally be vested in the government and the practice in no real sense, differs from practices normally followed by governments; or 
2. Any form of subsidy that would support income or price in the sense of Article XVI of GATT 1994.","As I see it, a grant from the government to develop a new technology is likely a subsidy under Article (49) because it involves a direct financial contribution (a grant is a type of transfer of funds). This grant confers a benefit upon the recipient (the private company), and it is not something that governments normally do. Therefore, this is an example of a government conducting a 'direct transfer of funds' as described in Article (49) (1)(a)."
"A company, ABC Inc., received a government subsidy to support its domestic production of goods. The subsidy was given through a program that allowed companies to apply for funding based on their exporting performance. The program had objective criteria and conditions governing eligibility for the subsidy and its amount. However, only 10 out of 100 companies in the industry received subsidies from this program. ABC Inc. wants to know if it can be considered specific.","Article (50) 
1. A subsidy, as defined in Article 49 hereof, shall be deemed a specific subsidy that gives rise to countervailing measures as defined in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of said Article.
2. In order to determine whether a subsidy is specific to an enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries (hereinafter referred to as “certain enterprises”) within the jurisdiction of the granting authority, the following principles shall apply:
a. Where the granting authority, or the legislation pursuant to which the granting authority operates, explicitly limits access to a subsidy to certain enterprises, such subsidy shall be specific.
b. Where the granting authority, or the legislation pursuant to which the granting authority operates, establishes objective criteria or conditions governing the eligibility for a subsidy and its amount, specificity in this case shall not exist, provided that the eligibility is automatic and that such criteria and conditions are strictly adhered to;
c. Notwithstanding any appearance of non-specificity resulting from the application of the principles set forth in subparagraphs (a) and (b), if there are reasons that the subsidy may, in fact, be specific, other factors may be considered. Such factors are:
- Use of a subsidy program by a limited number of certain enterprises or predominant use by certain enterprises; or
- The granting authority gives disproportionately large amounts of subsidy to certain enterprises when compared with other enterprises, and the method such authority adopts when exercising the powers conferred to it on determining the granting of subsidy, taking into consideration the diversification of economic activities within the jurisdiction of the granting authority, as well as of the length of time during which the subsidy program is being applied.
3. A subsidy shall be specific when it is limited to certain enterprises located within a designated geographical region within the jurisdiction of the granting authority, noting that the establishment or change of generally applicable tax rates by all levels of government entitled to do so shall not be deemed to be a specific subsidy for the purpose hereof.
4. Subject to paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, the following subsidies shall be deemed to be specific by their nature:
a. Subsidies that are contingent, in law or in fact, upon the level of exporting performance, whether solely or as one of several other conditions.
b. Subsidies that are contingent, whether solely or as one of several other conditions, upon the use of domestic over imported goods.","Based on Article 50(2)(b) and (c), since the subsidy program had objective criteria and conditions governing eligibility for the subsidy and its amount, specificity in this case shall not exist. However, considering factor (c)(i), the fact that only 10 out of 100 companies received subsidies suggests that the subsidy may be specific after all. Therefore, according to Article 50(2)(c) and (4)(a), the subsidy is specific by nature due to its contingent upon exporting performance condition."

1. Determining the total subsidy amount received by the foreign producer or exporter recipient, including the subsidy amount received during the period  of investigation. 
2. Determining the individual amount of subsidy for each known foreign producer or exporter for the product under investigation. 
3. Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2) of this Article, in cases where the number of exporters, producers, importers, or types of  products involved or trade transactions is so large as to make it impracticable to de termine an individual subsidy amount for each known exporter or producer, the investigation may be limited to an examination of a reasonable number of Related Parties , products or transactions by using samples which are statistically valid on the basis of information available at the time of the selection, or on the basis of the largest percentage of the volume of production, sales or exports which can reasonably be investigated within the given time -limit. 
4. Deducing from the calculated subsidy amount any fe es or costs incurred in order to qualify for, or to obtain the subsidy, or export taxes, duties or other charges levied on the export of the product under investigation to the State. 
5. The amount of subsidy shall be calculated per unit of the product under investigation exported to the State.","To calculate the subsidy per unit of the product exported to the State, we need to follow Article (51) and determine the individual amount of subsidy for each known foreign producer or exporter. Since there are multiple producers and exporters involved, we can use a sample of related parties, products, or transactions that is statistically valid based on information available at the time of selection. According to Article (51), paragraph 3, this is acceptable when it's impracticable to determine an individual subsidy amount for each known exporter or producer. Therefore, we would deduct any fees or costs incurred in order to qualify for, or obtain the subsidy, and then calculate the subsidy per unit based on the total subsidy amount received by the foreign producer or exporter."

With regard to the volume of subsidized imports, consideration shall be made to whether there has been a significant increase in subsidized imports, either in absolute terms or relative to production or consumption in the State’s market. b. With regard to the effect of subsidized dumped on the prices of the sale of the similar product in the domestic market, consideration shall be made to whether: - There has been a significant price undercutting in subsidized imports as compared with the price of a domestic similar products. - There has been a significant price decline in the domestic similar products; or - The effect of such imports is to prevent price increases in the domestic similar products, which otherwise would have occurred, to a significant degree. c. No one or several of the factors identified in this paragraph can necessarily provide decisive guidance to material injury. 2. The impact of the subsidized imports on the domestic industry involved, through an evaluation of all relevant economic factors and indices having a bearing on the state of the industry, including: a. Actual and potential decline in sales, profits, production, market share, productivity, return on investments, or utilization of capacity. b. Factors affecting the domestic market prices; actual and potential negative effects on cash flow, inventories, employment, wages, investment, growth, and ability to increase capital; and c. In case of agricultural products, whether there has been an increased burden on government support programs. d. This list is not exhaustive, nor can any one or more of these factors necessarily give decisive guidance to the occurrence of material injury. 3. The impact of the subsidized imports shall be assessed in relation to the domestic production of the similar product, when available data allow separate identification of that production on the basis of criteria, such as the production process and producers' sales and profits. If such separate identification of production is not possible, the evaluation of the impact of subsidized imports shall be undertaken by searching in narrowest group or range of products which include the similar product on which the necessary information can be provided.","To identify material injury to domestic industry due to subsidized imports, follow Article (53) steps: First, examine the volume of subsidized imports and their impact on prices in the domestic market. Check if there has been a significant increase in subsidized imports or price undercutting compared to domestic similar products. If so, consider whether this has led to price decline or prevented price increases in domestic similar products. Then, evaluate the impact of subsidized imports on the domestic industry through relevant economic factors and indices. This includes actual and potential declines in sales, profits, production, market share, productivity, return on investments, or utilization of capacity, as well as effects on cash flow, inventories, employment, wages, investment, growth, and ability to increase capital. Finally, assess the impact of subsidized imports in relation to domestic production of similar products, using available data and criteria such as production process and producers' sales and profits.

"A company called XYZ Inc. has been experiencing a decline in sales of its domestic-made widgets, and it suspects that this is due to an increase in imports from a foreign country, China. The company wants to determine if there is a threat of material injury to the domestic industry based on the facts rather than mere allegations or conjecture.","Article (54)
1. A threat of material injury on the domestic industry shall be identified based on the facts rather than merely allegations, conjecture, or unreasonable possibility and on an examination of whether such injury is clearly foreseen and imminent, subject to the following:

a. Nature of the subsidy in question and trade effects likely to arise therefrom.
b. A significant rate of increase of subsidized imports into the domestic market indicating the likelihood of substantially increased importations.
c. Sufficient production capacity of the exporter or an imminent, substantial increase in such capacity indicating the likelihood of substantially increased subsidized exports to the domestic market, taking into account the availability of other export markets to accommodate any additional exports.
d. Whether imports are entering at prices that will have a significant depressing or suppressing effect on domestic prices and would likely increase demand for further imports;
e. Inventories of the product under investigation.

2. Other relevant factors that are supported by sufficient evidence may be taken into consideration. However, no one or several of these factors listed above, alone or in combination, can necessarily give decisive guidance but the totality of the factors considered shall lead to a conclusion that more subsidized exports are imminent and that, unless countervailing measures action are taken, the material injury will occur.","Based on the facts, I conclude that there is a threat of material injury to the domestic industry. The nature of the subsidy in question (Article 54) allows for subsidized imports into the domestic market, which has led to a significant rate of increase in imports. This increase in imports indicates the likelihood of substantially increased importations, and with sufficient production capacity from China, there is an imminent threat of substantially increased subsidized exports to our market. Additionally, the prices at which these imports are entering our market will have a significant depressing effect on domestic prices, likely increasing demand for further imports. Inventories of the product under investigation also suggest that there may be an overstocking in the Chinese market, leading to even more exports to our country. According to Article 54, this totality of factors leads me to conclude that more subsidized exports are imminent and that, unless countervailing measures are taken, material injury will occur."
"A domestic manufacturer of steel pipes, 'Pipes Inc.', claims that subsidized imports from China are causing injury to their industry. However, there may be other factors at play.","Article (55)

2. Known factors other than subsidized imports, which are at the same time injuring the domestic industry, shall be examined, and injuries caused by these other factors shall not be attributed to the subsidized imports. Factors which may be relevant in this respect include, inter alia: 
a. The volume and prices of non-subsidized imports.
b. Decline in demand or changes in the patterns of consumption.
c. Commercial restrictions and competitions between domestic and foreign producers.
d. Development of export performance and productivity of the domestic industry.","To determine if subsidized imports are causing injury to Pipes Inc.'s industry, we need to verify that other factors are not at play. We should examine factors such as the volume and prices of non-subsidized imports (Article 55(2)(a)), decline in demand or changes in consumption patterns (Article 55(2)(b)), commercial restrictions and competitions between domestic and foreign producers (Article 55(2)(c)), and development of export performance and productivity of the domestic industry (Article 55(2)(d)).

What should happen to an investigation when the amount of subsidy is minimal?,"Article (57) 
 An immediate termination of the investigation shall be recommended without imposing measures in any of the following cases: 
 1. Withdrawal of the complaint, unless where such termination is against the State’s interest . 
 2. There is no sufficient evidence for the existence of subsidization, injury,  or causal relationship between them to justify the continuation of an investigation . 
 3. When the amount of subsidy is minimal , i.e. less than one percent (1%) of the amount. In case of a subsidy from a developing country, the overall level of subsidies granted upon the product in question shall not exceed two percent (2%) of its value calculated on a per unit basis .

b. Related Parties have been given adequate opportunity to submit information and make comments; and
 c. An initial affirmative determination of subsidy indicates that there is a consequent injury to the domestic industry; and that such measures are necessary to prevent injury being caused during the investigation. However, an initial negative determination of subsidy does not necessarily lead to termination of an investigation; however, in such a case, no provisional measures shall be imposed.
2. Provisional countervailing measures may take the form of provisional customs duties or, preferably, take the form of cash deposits or guarantee bonds that are not greater than the provisionally estimated amount, provided that provisional measures shall not be applied sooner than 60 days from the initiation of the investigation.
3. Provisional Measures shall be imposed for the shortest possible period not exceeding four (4) months.","No, it is not possible to impose provisional countervailing measures without giving related parties adequate opportunity to submit information and make comments, as per Article (58).

Undertakings.","Based on Article (60), I determine that the countervailing duty should remain valid only for as long as necessary to offset the subsidy causing the injury. Since the subsidy is ongoing, the duty should expire not later than five years from its imposition or the date of the next review, whichever is earlier. If a review determines that the expiry would lead to a continuation or recurrence of the subsidy and injury, the duty may remain in place until further review. (Article 60, Paragraphs 1 and 2)"
A company named XYZ Inc. wants to investigate whether imports of steel from Country A are being subsidized and causing injury to domestic industries. What should they do?,"Article (61) 
1. Upon the approval of the Minister or his delegate , an investigation may be suspended or terminated without countervailing measures be imposed when the Department receives satisfactory voluntary price undertakings from any exporters, which eliminates the injurious effect of the subsidy. Such undertakings shall take any of the following forms: 
a. Approval of the government of the exporting country to cancel or limit subsidization or to take other measures limiting effects thereof. 
b. The commitment of the exporter to review its prices so as to ensure that the adverse effects of subsidy have been terminated. 
2. Price undertakings shall not be sought or accepted from exports unless an initial affirmative determination of subsidization, injury, and a causal relationship has been made. 
3. Price undertaking offered shall not be accepted if their acceptance is considered impractical, as for the number of actual or potential exporters is too great, or for any other reasons, including reasons of general policy. Should the case arise and when practicable, the exporter shall be provided with the reasons that have led to a consideration that the acceptance of an undertaking would be inappropriate and shall, to the extent possible, be given an opportunity to make written comments thereon. 
4. Parties providing a price undertaking shall submit a non-confidential version of such undertakings, so that it may be made available to Related Parties of the investigation on request. 
5. Price undertakings may be suggested by the Department to exporters; however, no exporter shall be forced to enter into such undertakings. The fact that exporters do not offer or accept such undertakings shall in no way prejudice the consideration of the case. However, it may be determined that a threat of injury is more likely to be realized if the subsidized imports continue.","To investigate whether imports of steel from Country A are being subsidized and causing injury to domestic industries, XYZ Inc. should first determine whether there has been an initial affirmative determination of subsidization, injury, and a causal relationship between the two. If so, they can consider seeking voluntary price undertakings from exporters in Country A. Article (61) allows for this possibility if it eliminates the injurious effect of the subsidy. However, if acceptance of such undertakings is considered impractical or not practicable, XYZ Inc. should explore other options to address the issue."
"A company, Exporter A, has entered into a price undertaking to eliminate the margin of subsidization after an investigation showed that they were dumping their products. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, the market prices have increased and Exporter A wants to know what steps they need to take. What should they do?","Article (62) 
1. Increases in export prices under such price undertakings shall be proportionate to the extent necessary to eliminate the margin of subsidization. Price undertakings shall remain in force only as long as they are necessary to counteract the injurious effect of such subsidization.
2. Where price undertakings are accepted, the investigation of subsidization and injury shall nevertheless be completed if an exporter so desires or the Department so decides. In such a case:
a. If a negative determination of dumping or injury is made by the Minister or his delegate , the price undertaking shall automatically lapse. Except in cases where such a determination is due in large part to the existence of such an undertaking. In such cases, it may be required that an undertaking is maintained for a reasonable period consistent with the provisions hereof.
b. In the event that an affirmative determination of subsidization and injury is made by the Minister or his delegate , the undertaking shall continue consistent with its terms and the provisions hereof.","Based on Article (62) of the law, Exporter A should consider maintaining their price undertaking for a reasonable period to counteract the injurious effect of the subsidy. This is because an affirmative determination of subsidization and injury has been made by the Minister or his delegate, as stated in clause b of Article 62. The undertaking will continue consistent with its terms and the provisions hereof."
What would happen if an exporter fails to comply with providing information on periodical basis and pertinent data verification?,"Article (63) 
 1. Exporter , or governments of exporting countries whose undertakings have been accepted , 
 shall provide on periodical basis to the Department information relevant to the fulfilment  of 
 such undertakings and shall permit verification of pertinent data. Failure to comply  with such 
 requirements shall be deemed to be a violation of such undertakings. 
 2. If it is found that the price undertaking is violated by the exporter or the governments of 
 exporting countries, a recommendation shall be submitted to the Minister or his delegate  to 
 impose provisional countervailing measures in accordance with Article 58 hereof and on the 
 basis of the best information available. In such a case, final countervailing duties  may be 
 retroactively levied on goods released from the date of violation , with no more than ninety 
 (90) days before the application of such provisional measures. 
 3. If it is found that the price undertaking is violated by any exporter, the Minister or his delegate 
 may forthwith impose the provisional or definitive countervailing measures which have been 
 already imposed on other exporters; provided that the exporter has been granted an 
 opportunity to comment and unless it has withdrawn the undertakings. 
 Chapter Six 
 Retroactive Application","As per Article 63, if an exporter fails to comply with providing information on periodical basis and pertinent data verification, it shall be deemed a violation of such undertakings. According to Article 2, in this case, the Minister or his delegate may submit a recommendation to impose provisional countervailing measures, which may include retroactively levying final countervailing duties on goods released from the date of violation."
Can provisional measures be applied retroactively for the period prior to the date of imposition?,"Article (64) 
1. Provisional measures and definitive countervailing measures and duties shall only be applied 
to products imported for consumption from the date of imposition, subject to the exceptions in paragraph 2 of this Article, and Articles 66 and 67 hereof.

What happens to the provisional duties paid or payable when the final countervailing duties are higher/lower than the provisional ones?,"Article (65) 
1. Where the final countervailing duties are higher than the provisional duties paid or payable, or the amount estimated for the purpose of security, the difference shall not be collected. If the definitive duties are lower than the provisional duties paid or payable, or the amount estimated for the purpose of security, the difference shall be reimbursed, or the duties recalculated.
2. Where a final determination is negative, any cash deposit made during the period of the application of provisional countervailing measures shall be refunded and any bonds shall be expeditiously released.","According to Article (65), if the final countervailing duties are higher than the provisional ones, the difference will not be collected. If they are lower, the difference will be reimbursed or the duties recalculated. (Article (65))"

What can they do?","Article (66) Notwithstanding paragraph 2 (b) of Article 64 hereof, where a final determination of threat of material injury or material impediment has been made, but no injury has yet occurred, final countervailing du ties may be imposed only from the date of the final determination of a threat of material injury or material impediment . Any cash deposit made during the period of the application of such provisional measures shall be refunded and any bonds shall be expeditiously released.","Based on Article 66, since no injury has occurred yet, I can only impose countervailing duties from the date of the final determination of a threat of material injury or material impediment. All cash deposits made during this period will be refunded, and any bonds will be expeditiously released."

"A company called XYZ Inc. imports solar panels into the country, and it's been observed that the quantity of solar panels imported has increased significantly over the past year. The domestic industry that produces solar panels in the country has seen a decline in sales and profits during this period. Is this an unjustifiable increase in imports that threatens to cause serious injury to the domestic industry?","Article (71) 
1. A preventive measure may be taken to a product being imported irrespective of its source, if it is established that such product is being imported in unjustifiable increased quantities, whether absolute or relative to the State’s production, and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause a serious injury to the domestic industry that produced like or directly competitive products.
2. A determination of whether the unjustifiable  increase of imports has caused or are threatening to cause serious inju ry to the domestic industry shall be based on objective evidence and facts and an existence of a causal relationship between such imports and serious injury or threat thereof. This determination shall be made by evaluating all relevant, objective, and quantifiable factors affecting the position of the domestic industry, taking into consideration 
the following factors:
a. Ratio and volume of increase of imports of the product under investigation, in absolute or relative terms to the State’s production.
b. Impact o f such increased imports on the domestic industry, including volume of sales, production, productivity, capacity utilization, inventories, profits, losses, labour  and  market share.
c. A causal relationship between the increase of imports of the product under investigation and the serious injury or threat thereof shall be identified. In the event that factors other than an increase in imports cause simultaneously injury to the domestic industry, such injury may not be attributed to increased imports.","To determine if this is an unjustifiable increase in imports that threatens to cause serious injury to the domestic industry, we must evaluate all relevant, objective, and quantifiable factors affecting the position of the domestic industry. Based on Article (71) of the law, we need to consider the ratio and volume of increase of imports, the impact of increased imports on the domestic industry, and a causal relationship between the increase of imports and serious injury or threat thereof. After evaluating these factors, it appears that there is a significant increase in imports of solar panels into the country, which has led to a decline in sales and profits for the domestic industry. This increase in imports also seems to be causing a serious injury to the domestic industry. Therefore, according to Article (71), this is considered an unjustifiable increase in imports that threatens to cause serious injury to the domestic industry."
A domestic industry claims that it will face material injury if imports of a certain product increase at a rate of 20% per annum for the next 3 years. The industry also claims that exports from other countries are increasing and there are no other significant export markets available. Will this claim be considered as a threat to the domestic industry?,"Article (72) 

1. A threat of material injury on the domestic industry shall be identified on facts and not merely on allegation, conjecture , or remote possibility and on an examination of whether such injury is clearly foreseen and imminent.
2. In determining the existence of a threat of serious injury to the domestic industry, the following shall be taken into account:
a. The rate of increase of imports into the domestic market indicating the likelihood of substantially increased importations .
b. The significant export capacity of exporting countries or an imminent increase in such capacity indicates that exports may increase significantly in the domestic market.
c. The availability of other export markets, other than the domestic market, which accommodates any additional exports.
d. Any other significant factors with sufficient indications.","As I evaluate this claim, I need to identify whether it is a threat to the domestic industry based on Article (72). According to this article, I must examine whether such injury is clearly foreseen and imminent. Based on the information provided, the rate of increase in imports is 20% per annum for the next 3 years, which indicates a likelihood of substantially increased importations (Article (72), clause 2a). Additionally, exports from other countries are increasing, which suggests that there may be an imminent increase in such capacity (Article (72), clause 2b). Furthermore, there is no mention of other significant export markets available, which implies that the domestic market may be the only option for these exporting countries. Therefore, considering all these factors, I conclude that this claim is a valid threat to the domestic industry, as it is clearly foreseen and imminent (Article (72), clause 1)."
A sudden surge in imports of steel products has led to concerns about the impact on domestic industries. What measures can be taken to prevent irreparable damage?,"Article (73) In the event of critical circumstances, the Minister or his delegate may, upon a recommendation from the Advisory Committee, adopt provisional preventive duties, if it is determined that the product under investigation is being imported in unjustifiable increased quantities, absolute or relative to the domestic production, causing or threatening to cause serious injury to the domestic industry, which will be irreparable or remediable if such measures were not taken on time.","In order to prevent irreparable damage to the domestic steel industry, I recommend that provisional preventive duties be adopted under Article (73) of the law. This measure would be taken in response to the unjustifiable increased quantities of steel products being imported, which are causing or threatening to cause serious injury to the domestic industry."
"A company, XYZ Inc., has been experiencing financial difficulties due to increased imports of similar products from another country. They suspect that these imports are causing serious injury to their domestic industry and want to know what measures they can take.","Article (74) Provisional preventative duties shall take the form of tariff increases in accordance with the applicable customs duties, taking into account the following: Cabinet Resolution of 2018 Concerning the Executive Regulations of Federal Law of 2017 Concerning Anti-Dumping, Countervailing, and Preventive Measures 48 1. Provisional preventative duties shall be applied for no more than two hundred (200) days, during which the pertinent requirement of the prevention investigation hereunder. 2. Provisional preventative duties shall be repaid if the subsequent investigation does not result in a determination that increased imports have caused or threaten to cause serious injury to the domestic industry.","To address their concerns, XYZ Inc. can apply for provisional preventative duties under Article (74) of the law. This would involve submitting an application to the relevant authorities, providing evidence of the increased imports and their impact on the domestic industry. The provisional duties would be in the form of tariff increases, and would be applied for a maximum period of 200 days. If, after conducting the investigation, it is determined that the increased imports do not cause or threaten to cause serious injury to the domestic industry, then the provisional duties would be repaid. (Article 74)"
A company in the domestic industry has been experiencing serious injury due to an increase in imports of a product. The Advisory Committee recommends applying a definitive preventive measure. What should be done?,"Article 75
1. In the case that the Advisory Committee found, upon the conclusions made by the Department, that the absolute or relative increase of the imports of the product under investigation caused or threaten to cause serious injury to the domestic industry, it may recommend to the Minister or his delegate to apply a definitive preventive measure in the form of quantitative constraint, increase in customs duties in accordance with the applicable custom duties and/or any other measures, taking into consideration that the definitive preventive measure shall be applied to the extent necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury caused or threaten to be caused to the domestic industry.
2. If a quantitative constraint is applied, the determined quantities shall not be less than the average of imports in the last three (3) years for which statistics are available, unless a clear justification is given that a different level is necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury to the domestic industry.
3. Where a quota is allocated among countries having a substantial interest in exporting a product under investigation, an agreement may be reached with such countries to share these quotas.
4. In cases where paragraph (3) of this Article is not reasonably practicable, the quotas allocation shall be based upon the proportions of products imported from such countries, during a previous reference period, of the total quantity or value of imports of the product under investigation. Any special factors which may have affected or may be affecting the trade in the product under investigation shall be considered.
5. In the event of serious injury, and not a threat of serious injury, the allocation of the quotas may be made on different bases than those envisaged under paragraphs 3 and 4 above; provided that consultations are conducted under the auspices of the WTO Committee on Safeguards and that a clear demonstration is provided to the Committee that: 
a. Imports from certain countries increased disproportionately to the total increase of imports from the product under investigation during the reference period.
b. The reasons for deviating from the methodology of quota allocation envisaged under paragraphs 3 and 4 above are justified; and
c. The conditions of deviating from the methodology of quota allocation envisaged under paragraphs 3 and 4 above are equitable to all suppliers of the product under investigation.
6. The validity of measure imposed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (5) of this Article shall not exceed the initial period specified in article (77) hereof.","According to Article 75, since the Advisory Committee found that the increase in imports has caused or threatens to cause serious injury to the domestic industry, we should recommend applying a definitive preventive measure in the form of quantitative constraint, increase in customs duties, or other measures to prevent or remedy the serious injury. We must ensure that the determined quantities are not less than the average of imports in the last three years for which statistics are available, unless a clear justification is given that a different level is necessary. If an agreement can be reached with countries having a substantial interest in exporting the product, we should share the quotas among them. However, if this is not reasonably practicable, we should allocate the quotas based on the proportions of products imported from each country during a previous reference period, considering any special factors that may have affected or may be affecting trade. If serious injury has occurred and not just threatened, we can allocate the quotas on different bases under certain conditions."
Can preventive measures be applied to a product originating from a developing country WTO member if its import share in the domestic market exceeds 3%?,"Article (76) No preventive measures may be applied to any product originating in a developing country Member of the WTO as long as its share of imports of the product under investigation in the domestic market does not exceed three percent (3%), and provided that developing countries with less than three percent (3%) import share collectively account for no more than nine percent (9%) of the total imports of the product under investigation.","According to Article 76, no preventive measures can be applied if the import share exceeds 3%. Since the question asks about a single developing country WTO member, we need to check if its import share is less than or equal to 3%. If it is, then yes, preventive measures are allowed. Law Article: (76)"
Can I re-apply a preventive measure for a product that was previously subject to such a measure?,"Article (77)

However, the industry also requests a gradual release of the measures at regular intervals.","Article 78
1. The extension of the application of the Final Preventive Measures depends on the findings of a new investigation conducted in accordance with the same provisions set forth in Sections 2 and 5 hereof. T he necessity of the application shall establish that applying the preventive measures shall be continued to prevent or remedy serious injury and that there is sufficient evidence that the domestic industry is subject to reconstruction.
2. In the event that a definitive preventive measure is being taken for more than one year, it shall be progressively released at regular intervals during the period of application. If the duration of the measure exceeds three (3) years, the case shall be reviewed not later than the mid-term of the application of such measure, and, in such a case, it shall be withdrawn or be promptly released, if appropriate.
Section Five
Advisory Committee","Based on Article 78, since the Final Preventive Measures have been in place for more than one year, they should be progressively released at regular intervals. If the duration of the measures exceeds three years, the case must be reviewed not later than the mid-term of the application.
